# Chapter One  
## Why We Raize The Vibe

Hi. We’re Chrix and Sarah.

Before we tell you how this started, we want to tell you where we are now.

By day, we run a small vibecoding studio called **Raize The Vibe**, where we help people untangle the internet and build digital systems that reflect who they are and what they’re trying to create. It’s creative work. It’s technical work. And it’s grounded in truth.

**Raize The Vibe Apparel is different.**

This is our mission.

This drop is about our freedom, about loving and protecting our kids, and about showing up for our community without hiding.

Sarah and I have been clean since **January 11, 2024**. That date marks the beginning of a life we never thought we’d get back. That’s why this drop happens on the 11th.

Now, here’s how we got here.

---

Two years ago, we were living in our car in Arkansas—about a thousand miles from home—which is still funny to say out loud because who goes to Arkansas on purpose?

We didn’t. We ended up there.

I can still feel that season in my body if I sit still long enough. The kind of cold that makes your bones argue with you. The kind of hunger that turns a dollar into a plan. The kind of exhaustion where tomorrow feels like a rumor somebody else gets to believe.

We were lost in darkness, and meth was tangled up in that darkness. Not as a headline. Not as a story to shock you. Just the truth.

One night, we woke up in a Walmart parking lot. Windows fogged, phone almost dead, the world outside still dark. You take inventory in moments like that. How much gas. How much time. How much dignity you think you have left. You tell yourself you are going to move, you are going to work, you are going to keep going. Not because you feel strong, but because you do not see another option.

And then a stranger did something holy.

At a gas station in Arkansas, someone offered us kindness like it was normal. No lecture. No judgment. No performance. Just compassion, like we were still human.

It did not solve everything. It did not teleport us home. But it cracked a door.

It reminded us we were still people.

So we stayed in that car for thirty days. We delivered food through DoorDash. We drove until the miles blurred. We split meals. We slept wherever we could. We tried to provide our own way, not because we were proud, but because we finally understood something hard. If someone cleaned up our mess again, we would just end up with a mess again.

We were learning responsibility. One day at a time. The next right thing.

Then grace showed up in a way we did not even know to ask for.

After those thirty days, we were invited to my mother’s home, at first just to take a shower and have a meal. That small opening became what we now call our hundred days of grace.

If you have never taken a real shower after living in your car, you might not understand what it feels like when the water hits your skin and you realize you are safe for a minute. Not fixed. Not finished. Just safe.

Those hundred days gave Sarah and me space to breathe, to soften, and to heal in ways we never even asked for. Our nervous systems stopped screaming long enough for our souls to breathe. We slept. We ate. We started telling the truth.

That is a big theme in our story.

Prayers being answered that we never prayed.

God moving obstacles that were bigger than us.

Not long after that, we drove to the airport to pick up my youngest daughter, Tabitha.

I was there when she was born, but I had been gone so long that it was not a memory she carried. For her, this was not a simple pickup.

This was the first time she was meeting her dad.

We picked her up three days before her eleventh birthday. And because God has a way of writing poetry with real life, we took her to Harry Potter World on her eleventh birthday, just like Harry.

She got her Hogwarts day on her eleventh, and we got a miracle we did not deserve. Our daughter holding our hands. Her laughter. Her eyes taking it all in. A brand new memory replacing a decade of absence.

From there we went to an Airbnb, and we began what we can only call a reuniting adventure. That adventure turned into a road trip to Texas where Tabitha met her brothers and sisters for the first time.

And then God kept writing the story with the kind of mercy that makes you laugh through tears.

Because we did not raise our hand and say we were ready to be everyday parents.

God put a little girl in our arms whose mom was serving the same darkness that overcame us for so long.

I get to hold her as she cries herself to sleep asking why her mom is not the mom she needs.

That is good medicine.

Not because we enjoy pain. Because it keeps us honest.

It keeps us humble.

It reminds us that love is not a caption.

Love is responsibility.

After we arrived in Texas, we did something that mattered more than it sounds on paper.

We moved close, two and a half blocks away from my ex wife.

Not to ask for anything.

Not to take.

Not to demand what we had not earned.

We moved close to carry weight. To be useful. To show up in the unglamorous places where real repentance lives. School drop offs. Pickups after drama. Schedules. Early mornings. Late nights. Even a 4 a.m. drive to get a kid where they needed to be for a debate competition.

We were trying to live our repentance, not perform it.

And God did something that still does not make sense unless you have lived it.

We were welcomed back in.

Friday night pizza and a movie became routine. Ordinary family moments became normal again. The kind of restoration that feels impossible when you know exactly why people had to protect themselves from you.

That is the miracle.

And it is also where Raize The Vibe truly began.

Because coming home to your children changes you.

When we returned, our older kids were not the babies we left behind. They had grown. They had become. Some of our kids are gender nonconforming. Names changed. Identities evolved.

In that moment, something unexpected happened inside me.

My opinions melted.

Not because I suddenly had every answer, but because the real question was not political or ideological.

It was parental.

These are my children.

The children God entrusted to me.

And my only desire became clear.

That my children would know they are loved, and they are safe.

Raize The Vibe is our refusal to pass pain down.

It is our choice to stop generational hurt instead of baptizing it with excuses.

It is our choice to not hide behind the sentence, that’s just how my parents did it.

It is our willingness to ask the most dangerous question a grown adult can ask.

Who would I be today if I was not hurt the way I was hurt.

Then it is our responsibility to live like that answer is true.

Because hurt people hurt people.

That is not an excuse. That is a warning.

And our job now, our Christian job, our human job, is to stop the chain.

My job is to hurt no one.

That is how Jesus walked. That is what He asked. He did not tell us to win arguments. He did not tell us to dominate other people’s identities. He told us to love.

And love is not demanding the world take care of your fears.

Love is taking responsibility for your fears and refusing to use them as weapons.

We learned that lesson again when we went looking for a church home.

Some places made it clear our family did not fit. Some places carried fear like it was faith. But we also found glimpses of God in real people, love that felt like shelter. And the place that felt safest for our kids was not the loudest about being right.

That experience burned something into us.

We do not want a faith that makes people unsafe.

We want a faith that looks like Jesus.

That is also why we speak the way we speak about trauma, addiction, and healing.

We do not believe we are sick. We do not believe our story is best explained by a permanent disease label.

What we do believe is this.

When someone is a victim of trauma, especially complex trauma, the first thing that matters is coping. Drugs and alcohol can become refuge that most people will never need to understand because most people never had to survive what a trauma victim survived.

When you tell the truth about that, you can actually help somebody.

Because if you remove drugs and alcohol from a trauma victim without offering a healing solution, you are asking them to feel all the pain that makes them want to die, with no tools and no support. Too often people are told they are not doing it right, when the truth might be they need a different approach, a different level of care, a different path home.

We believe many paths lead home.

We believe harm reduction saves lives.

We believe keeping people alive long enough to come home is holy work.

So this is what Raize The Vibe means.

It does not matter if you have been wrapped up in meth.

It does not matter if you are trans.

It does not matter if you are Christian.

It does not matter if you are Black, white, or anything in between.

We are all part of the same tribe.

We have all been hurt.

We have all hurt each other.

And the way out is not by demanding our fears be taken care of.

The way out is taking care of our fears, and inserting love into our lives on purpose, until love becomes how we live.

This story is God’s.

This brand is God’s.

These shirts are not the point. They are a platform. They are art with a purpose. They are flags we were asked to raise.

We are simply serving the Lord the way He called us to, by telling the truth, by making something beautiful, and by welcoming people who have felt pushed out into the same tribe.

That is our story.

That is our flag.

And if you’re here… you’re welcome in it.
